# Project-1-Website-Bio


First Project building Website using HTML &amp; CSS


SUMMARY

The biggest challenge for me on this first project was learning to actually start building in an open environment compared to before when I was learning to code within the closed-environment of a structured course.  

I easily spent more time learning about the environment and the tools compared to actually coding for this project but I like the open-source nature of coding and can understand that coding isn’t done in a vacuum and ultimately it’s meant to be collaborated with others in solving complex problems.
